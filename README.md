## Intro
From the Original Creator:
> I'm afraid the past few years I've been busy with further study, and not really found the time or enthusiasm to continue the texture. I've since let the torch be carried by those who want to update the texture pack themselves. Really great to hear you were a fan of the pack ðŸ™‚

I think Good Morning Craft was an amazing resource pack, but unfortunately as stated above, the original author could not continue creating this resource pack. If you are a fan of this texture pack, please help and contribute to "revive" this texture pack so that it is compatiable with the latest versions of Minecraft!


## Install

1. Open Minecraft and log in.
2. Select the "Resource Packs" option.
3. Click "Open Resource Pack Folder" which will open a new window.
4. Drag this zip folder (not the contents, but the zip file) into this folder.
5. Select Good Morning Craft in the list of resource packs.
