## Intro
From the Original Creator:
> I'm afraid the past few years I've been busy with further study, and not really found the time or enthusiasm to continue the texture. I've since let the torch be carried by those who want to update the texture pack themselves. Really great to hear you were a fan of the pack ðŸ™‚

I think Good Morning Craft was an amazing resource pack, but unfortunately as stated above, the original author could not continue creating this resource pack. If you are a fan of this texture pack, please help and contribute to "revive" this texture pack so that it is compatiable with the latest versions of Minecraft!


## Install
warning I don't know If this is gonna be really helpful but I'm gonna try, so first you will need minetest you can get it here http://www.minetest.net once you have that you download the texture pack then you go to your minetest installation directory for me it's C:\games\minetest then go to the textures folder and put it in there (Note you will have to extract the zip)

1. Click on `Clone or Download` and `Download ZIP` on the top of this page
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. Go to your Minetest installation directory. E.g. `C:\Games\minetest\textures`
4. Copy the extracted `.zip` file into the `textures/` folder.
